Security: 
- Switch from CryptoJS to browser Crypto API:
- Faster hashing and encryption: full binary and async program-chain from hashing to encryption to emoji generation
- Improved encryption security: now uses AES-GCM, AES-CTR (256-bit key; random 12 and 16 byte IV) instead of [ CryptoJS AES (AES-CBC?) and Blowfish ]
- Removed hashing with MD5 and other hashing algorithms not supported by Crypto API
- XOR-Encryption is now using binary as input and output and the key length is now fixed 4096-byte, derived from seeded hash algorithm and provided key
- Minimum encrypted output length decreased by ~14% compared to latest v2 (from 35 to 30 characters)
- Encryption length ratio (message length to encrypted output length) decreased noticeably

Feature:
- New feature: Private conversion algorithm
- A way to obfuscate text in a unique pattern using a secure permutation algorithm with SHA-256
- Generate a unique URL corresponding with the pattern (for sharing)
- Algorithm key is stored in localStorage, algorithm can be removed.

QOL:
- Removed FAQ questions mentioning CryptoJS
- Sorted FAQ into 3 categories (for now)
- Last used site is now stored in localStorage and loaded when visiting again
- Added a check for crypto API support
- Visual feedback when copying data
- Removed shipping with CryptoJS and base-64.js

TODO: 
- Language support for the new features 
- FAQ for private algorithm
