## Idea üí°

You want to send some confidential text and confuse prying eyes?
Fear no more: Simply generate a secret emoji key and use it to securely encrypt your message.
Guess what? The output is emojis too!
The idea is to implement a protocol where only you and the receiver knows what the key and the message is.

## Features ‚úÖ

### Usability ‚ò∫Ô∏è

- Convert text to emojis and back using the convert option and generate a private conversion algorithm with an unique URL
- Generate emoji keys which look like encrypted messages
- Save keys within the browser
- Site can be added to homescreen on Android and iOS to act as an app (Webapp)
- The web app is available in 7 languages (feel free to improve the automated translations)
- Dark mode

### Basic Security Information üîê

- All Encryption and decryption happens on the local device, no data is sent anywhere (Just be sure that there's no virus on your device)
- Emoji key generation has the same footprint as the encrypted output (it's generated using the encrypt function)

#### Advanced Security Information

- **Three Chained Encryption Methods:** Your text is encrypted using three chained encryption methods: AES-GCM, AES-CTR, and XOR; leveraging the browser Crypto API.
- The encryption step for AES-GCM use a random 96-bit IV that differs from the one used in the next AES encryption step; AES-CTR with a random 128-bit IV.
- **Final XOR Encryption:** The final XOR encryption employs a 4096-byte key derived through hash methods. These methods generate salts with SHA-256 in a deterministic manner from a fixed seed and concatenate them with the used key (using SHA-512 for the final rounds) before combining everything into a single key.
- Key Hashing Process: During encryption, your key is hashed with four SHA algorithms in a long loop, making it difficult to brute-force the key. The length of the loop also depends on the key.
- **SHA Algorithms Used:** The hash loop utilizes SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 with equal weighting (4/4/4/4).
- **Data Input for Hashing:** In each round, the data fed into each hash algorithm consists of:
    1. The last key
    2. The key before that
    3. The key before that
    4. A custom salt that differs in each of the 16 switch cases
- **Custom Hash Loop Lengths:** As of version 1.1.0, different encryption algorithms have varying hash loop lengths and intermediate salt integers. Therefore, each of the three encryption algorithms uses a custom, deterministically derived key: 256-bit for AES and 4096-byte for XOR (as of version 3.0.0).
